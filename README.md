Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to run virtual servers, known as instances, to host applications and services. EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, and GPU-based workloads. It supports flexible configuration of CPU, memory, storage, and networking, along with features like auto-scaling, elastic load balancing, and integration with other AWS services. Users can choose different pricing models, including On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances, to balance cost and performance. EC2 gives full control over the operating system and software stack, making it ideal for hosting web applications, running enterprise software, processing big data, and much more in a secure, scalable, and reliable environment.
